<h1>**PRACTICE FOR THE AIRBNB CLONE CONSOLE**</h1>

**First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.**

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Our CLI will help us manage objects of our projects: 

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
